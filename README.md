# KindlyRecipes
A mod which blocks certain recipes defined in a json.
## How does it work? ❔
It's very easy: the mod autogenerates a json file (config/blocked_recipes.json)in the config folder, where you can define the recipes you want to block. The mod will then block these recipes from being crafted.

## Modify the recipes on the fly ✈️
If you want to modify the recipes "on the fly" without needing to restart the server, you can do */kindlyrecipes reload*


The mod is still in development, so if you have any suggestions or found a bug, please let us know! 🩵
